If you've seen me present at a cartographic meeting recently, there's a fair chance you've heard me talk about using tiling and/or weaving to make maps of complex multivariate data.^[Nothing _at all_ to do with web map tiles.] The idea is to break up map areas into multiple units by tiling so that we have available more than one shape to colour choropleth-style so that we can represent more than one variable in each area.

People have been enthusiastic about the concept and the look of the maps, but (I'm fairly sure) reticent about taking up the idea because doing so demanded a willingness to dive into writing python code to make such maps, or even just to explore the idea. For example, [this talk](https://dosull.github.io/weaving-space/presentations/Palmerston-North-Nov-2022/slides/) which gives a useful overview of the concepts is liberally sprinkled with snippets of python code. That was intended to make it easier for anyone interested to jump in and have a go at making their own maps. But realistically, it probably discouraged the vast majority!

Anyway, [I recently came across a tool called marimo](../../notebooks/2025-02-18-marimo.ipynb) that enables creation of [reactive python notebooks, which are shareable as apps](https://marimo.io). That got me thinking about providing a way to make tiled maps _without_ writing code, which might get a few more people interested in the idea.

## A prototype web app
We're _almost_ there. While you read the rest of this post, [load the app in another tab](https://dosull.github.io/mapweaver/app/){target="_blank"} (it takes a while to load, so keep reading...). 

Using the app you can experiment on a multivariate dataset: [Dan Exeter](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/d-exeter)'s [Index of Multiple Deprivation](https://imdmap.auckland.ac.nz/download/)^[See also Exeter DJ, Zhao J, Crengle S, Lee A, Browne M, 2017, [The New Zealand Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD): A new suite of indicators for social and health research in Aotearoa, New Zealand](https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181260) _PLOS ONE_ **12**(8) e0181260] (IMD) for Auckland 'city' in 2018.

You can choose how many variables you want to include (between 2 and 10), and what kind of tiling or weave pattern you want to use. You can also choose colour ramps to associated with each of the chosen variables. So with a few clicks, you can make this map

or this one

You can also modify the spacing or rotation of a chosen tiling, or (for a weave) the width of the strands

or experiment with different colour ramps and the resulting map appearance

## Feedback welcome!
It's proving trickier than I hoped to upload user data to the app (see this [issue](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo/issues/4031)) so this isn't the finished product, but it would still be useful to get any thoughts or reactions from prospective users. As far as that goes:

+ I _know_ it is slow to load. I don't think there is much I can do about this in a pyodide Web Assembly app that depends on several python packages beyond the core language. Just be patient... or if you have experience with this problem, get in touch and tell me how to fix it!
+ It's worth exploring the available options with _spacing_ set to a high value so that the refresh of the map is faster. Once you have a pattern you are happy with, then adjust the spacing to the desired value.

That aside, any thoughts just get in touch on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-o-sullivan-1b8a901b7/) or [email me](mailto:osullivan512@gmail.com)! We're also interested in thoughts about this mapping method, not just this implementation.
