Last week I gave talk about how I made a web app for our [tiled and woven maps work](https://github.com/DOSull/weaving-space)^[I should note here as I somehow failed to do in the talk that the tiled and woven maps work is in collaboration with Luke Bergmann at UBC in Canada.] to the [Wellington Python meetup](https://www.meetup.com/NZPUG-Wellington/) held at the [Sharesies](https://www.sharesies.nz/) office on the third Thursday of every month.

The talk was recorded, although the original was pretty choppy as a result of some weird interactions between google meet, macos workspaces, and full screen browser windows (or something) so the below is a re-recording I made the day after.

If you are mostly interested in how you can make a web app in pure python while writing no javascript, then skip to about 19 minutes in where I talk about [marimo](https://docs.marimo.io) and more or less competently demonstrate how easy it is to do. [I recently posted about marimo](../../notebooks/2025-02-18-marimo.html) when I first encountered it two or three months ago.

The app itself is [here](https://dosull.github.io/mapweaver/app/){target="blank"}. Be patient: it takes a little while to load, which is why I wrote _almost_ no javascript. The little I did write is to show a splash screen while the app loads in the background!
