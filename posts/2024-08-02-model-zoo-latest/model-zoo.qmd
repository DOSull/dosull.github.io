I've been diligently keeping the so-called 'model zoo' associated with our book [_Spatial Simulation_](../../books.qmd#spatial-simulation-exploring-pattern-and-process) updated for compatibility with new releases of NetLogo. Each time I generally manage to clean up a few parts of the code and slowly complete the 'Info' tabs (otherwise known as user documentation).

The models are available from [this repo](https://github.com/DOSull/model-zoo) and you can get an overview of what they're all about at [this website](https://patternandprocess.org). Really though, you should buy [the book](../../books.qmd#spatial-simulation):
