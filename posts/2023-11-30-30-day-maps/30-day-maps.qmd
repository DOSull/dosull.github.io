Finding myself unaccountably with time on my hands in November 2023, I thought I'd give the [30 Day Map Challenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/){target="_blank"}. I am not sure I'd recommend the experience. I mean, it's a kind of warped fun, but it's _hard_. I might have restricted my focus too much for it to stay interesting for a whole month, perhaps. Anyway, you can see what I made [here](https://dosull.github.io/30-day-maps-2023/) and a short slideshow reflecting on the experience [here](https://dosull.github.io/30-day-maps-2023/maps/maptime/maptime-30-days.html#/title-slide).

Here are my two favourite maps from the month:

![#27 Dots within dots to show all seven components _and_ the overall value of an index of deprivation](unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)
