The first [Call for Submissions to GIScience 2025](https://giscience2025.org/#cfp) has just come out (deadline for proceedings papers Jan 31 2025; for other submissions Apr 4 2025).

We're excited in Aotearoa New Zealand to be hosting this one, even if [I think it should be called giscience 2025](https://dosull.github.io/computing-geographically/other-stuff/giscience-not-GIScience.html) (note the non-capitalisation). I'm on the program committee so look forward (a little nervously) to a flood of submissions. It's nice for a change that it won't be us Aotearoans making the long trip.

The last big geospatial conference in NZ was Geocomputation 2019 which was greatly enjoyed by all who made it, and this one will be even better, I'm certain of it!
