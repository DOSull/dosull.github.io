From some time in March 2020 for two years I downloaded the latest reported COVID data for New Zealand, added them to my spreadsheet of the various numbers, and updated a timeline I was keeping in _R_. The download process got a lot easier when I was introduced to [the data downloader at University of Auckland eResearch](https://github.com/UoA-eResearch/nz-covid19-data-auto/).

As you can see, by the time I stopped things had gone pretty badly off the rails, and even a log scale wasn't helping much.

I can honestly say this was when I started to become competent with the `ggplot2` package, and for that, as well as the reassurance the daily ritual provided for about a year and a half (we were doing so well...), I am grateful.

### Addendum
I also mapped the progress of the vaccination program for a (much shorter) time. At least these numbers were released weekly and in a much more accessible form. Here's how the critical 'second dose' went:
