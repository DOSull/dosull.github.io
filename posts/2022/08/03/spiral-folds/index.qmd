I made an [observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@dosull/tomoko-fuse-spiral-crease-patterns) to generate crease patterns for the flat-foldable origami 'whirpool spirals' designed by Tomoko Fuse and presented in chapter 3 of her amazing book [_Spiral: Origami|Art|Design_](https://viereck-verlag.de/en/produkt/spiral-origami-art-design/). You'll find more details in the notebook.

The picture is an example of the folds it produces, or at any rate of the things _you_ can fold by cutting out and following the crease patterns it produces. You'll have to do the folding yourself, I'm afraid. 

If you'd like an idea of how the fold works without going to all the trouble of actually making one, then visit [Amanda Ghassaei](https://amandaghassaei.com/)'s [Origami Simulator](https://origamisimulator.org) and navigate to **Examples - Tessellations - Whirlpool Spiral**.
