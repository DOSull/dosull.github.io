[Dulux have had a range of colours named for places in New Zealand](https://www.dulux.co.nz/colour/colours-of-new-zealand/) for several years now. Clearly this is an opportunity for mapping too good to be missed. You can thank me later.

I gave a [presentation about how this map was made using _R_ to a Maptime! Wellington audience](https://dosull.github.io/dulux-colours-map/slides/maptime-slides.html), and it takes you through the code in enough detail to require no further explanation from this post!
