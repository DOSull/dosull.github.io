An intermittent side-project of mine over (github informs me) more than three years has been assembling a collection of useful functions or rather _reporters_ and _procedures_ written in NetLogo to make it just a little bit easier to do a range of fairly standard things in that language.

Don't get me wrong, NetLogo is _wonderful_ and I love it dearly. I find it tremendous fun to code in. But any time I start dealing in any serious way with lists and strings or slightly more obscure probability distributions, I find that I am repeating myself rewriting code I've written dozens of times before. This probably became most apparent when I was writing the [spatial COVID model](/portfolio/00-0-spatial-covid-model.qmd).

Anyway... the result has been [this extremely intermittent and informal set of netlogo source (`.nls`) files](https://github.com/DOSull/netlogo-utils) that you can import into a NetLogo model to get access to more useful list and string handling without having to write an extension.

No warranties of fitness are expressed or implied. If you find them useful, let me know!
