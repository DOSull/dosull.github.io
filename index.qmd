This is <span style="font-family:'Roboto Condensed','Arial Narrow',sans-serif;">**GEOSPATIAL STUFF**</span> where I offer expertise in data analytics and visualisation, simulation modelling, and training on all things geospatial. You'll find examples of current work in my [portfolio](portfolio.qmd) and [blog posts](blog.qmd). I am an experienced geospatial researcher, an [Honorary Professor](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/david-osullivan) at the University of Auckland, and [Research Affiliate at Motu](https://www.motu.nz/about-us/people/david-osullivan/). For more information [get in touch](mailto:osullivan512@gmail.com).

### Commmunicating stuff
I have written [three books](books.html) and [many research articles](publications.html). I have presented complex ideas to diverse audiences for 20+ years: see my [presentations](presentations.html), or [these slides](https://dosull.github.io/Spatial-Data-Science/site/docs/). Based on my decades of teaching experience [I offer training](training.qmd) to help organisations join up their data analytics and GIS teams using modern geospatial tools.

### Building things
I develop workflows to organise and analyse data, especially spatial data. I have built visualizations of complex data for many projects. You'll find examples among my [posts](blog.qmd). I write [well documented code](https://dosull.github.io/weaving-space/doc/weavingspace/) and can prototype [websites](portfolio/00-1-nz-commute-viewer.qmd) as needed. My web work is linked from these pages, just look around.
