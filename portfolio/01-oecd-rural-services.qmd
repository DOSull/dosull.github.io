![](oecd-rural-services-report-cover.png){style="float:left;width:40%; padding:0px 15px 15px 0px;"}Not a lot to say here, just to note that I recently assisted with reviewing and commentary on an OECD Report entitled [_Getting to Services in Towns and Villages_](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/getting-to-services-in-towns-and-villages_df1e9b88-en.html) on the variations across the OECD in the accessibility of various services across the settlement hierarchy.

As a geographer it was interesting to see this work from a more economistic perspective, and also somewhat amusing to hear that getting maps into OECD publications is an uphill battle given some ongoing uh... debate about territorial claims across the organisation!

That minor issue notwithstanding, it was a pleasure working with the folks at OECD. There's a lot of really great research going on outside the academy, something it is easy to lose site of when you've spent so long inside it.
