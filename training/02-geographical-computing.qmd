[Go to the materials](https://github.com/DOSull/Geographical-Computing){.button-link target="_blank"}

These pages outline a one semester (36 contact hours) class in python programming for geospatial that was last taught at Victoria University of Wellington as GISC 420 in the first half of 2022.

I am still in the process of cleaning the materials up for potential conversion into training materials. For the time being the materials are provided _gratis_ with no warrant as to their accuracy as a guide to python programming for geospatial but you may still find them useful all the same!

For more information [contact me](mailto:osullivan512@gmail.com), especially if any of these or materials on similar themes is of interest to your organisation.

**Note** Unfortunately, if you are not enrolled at a university or associated with a similar institution you might find links to some resources broken (e.g. DOI links to articles that are paywalled, or datasets that I do not have permission to share.)
