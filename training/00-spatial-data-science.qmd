These materials aim to help GIS users (even those with limited experience) transition to a more data science-centric approach. There is a particular emphasis on open source tools and on doing geospatial analysis in code using *R* as both are becoming increasingly important across the industry.

The materials are organised by theme and short courses to tailored to any or a selection of the themes can easily be arranged.
